Autoboxing and Unboxing

Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types
and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer , a
double to a Double , and so on. If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.
Here is the simplest example of autoboxing:

Character ch = 'a';

The rest of the examples in this section use generics. If you are not yet familiar with the syntax of
generics, see the Generics (Updated) lesson.
Consider the following code:

List<Integer> li = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 1; i < 50; i += 2)
li.add(i);
